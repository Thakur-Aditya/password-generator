# React + Vite
Made a Password Generator

What concepts did I learnt?
# 1. Use of "useCallback" hook 
     It is used to cache a function (basically baar baar components render na ho[if dependencies are unchanged] and ofcourse it should not be used everywhere)

    When not to use? - when you have to re-render your whole page or a big part of it 
    When to use it - If there are small small changes in your page where re-rendering the whole page is not advisable then use it.

# 2. Use of "useEffect" hook 
# 3. Use of "useRef" hook 
    Used to give reference of something - Lets you manipulate DOM

# 4. Use of "useState" hook 

    helps to add a state variable to your component - basically state change karsakte ho toh saari jageh change ho jaayega
